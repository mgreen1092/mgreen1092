I am a software engineer with a passion for creating innovative, efficient, and impactful websites and applications. As a Software Engineer Apprentice at General Assembly, I have created a variety of different web applications while using a different programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React, and MongoDB.

Prior to General Assembly, I gained experience as a data analyst which allowed me to obtain a technical background that has aided me in my journey to becoming a software engineer. This path has allowed me to solve complex problems in creative ways, all while continuing to learn and grow. I firmly believe in asking questions and staying curious.
